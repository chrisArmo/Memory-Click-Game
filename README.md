# Memory Click Game

Memory Click Game is built with React and allows players to challenge their memory by attempting to click on as many different images as they can before clicking on a previously clicked image, ending the current game.

## Playing The Game

With each image click, the images will shuffle on screen. When the user clicks a previously clicked image, they are notified of an incorrect image click and the game starts over.
